+00 | char[4] | "BXON"
+04 | u32     | some number, version?
+08 | u32     | ???????? (checksum maybe????)
+0C | char[?] | some identifier name
+20 | u32     | number of strings
+24 | u32     | some number (8?)
+28 | 26 26 26 26
+2C | u32[]   | offsets (from offset of offset) of strings: for example, offset of id 3 is 2C + 4 * 3 + offset[3]

each string is after a 26 26 26 26

26 26 26 26 is some kind of separator?
strings are UTF16-LE
40 40 is padding?
