+00 | char[4] | "PACK" or "PACA"
+04 | u32?    | size?
+08 | ?
+0C | u16     | entry count in some u32 offset table
+0E | u16     | offset of some u32 offset table

offset table link to this struct:
+00 | u16    | offset of data from here (aka size of header)
+02 | u16?   | ? seems unread
+04 | u32    | size of data
+08 | char[] | filename

"PACA" from end:
    -08 | 3byte | offset (down from end) of lower bound
    -05 | 1byte | offset (down from end) of upper bound
    -04 | 3byte | size of unpacked data?

    I think this may be some lzss again, but backwards
