+00 | char[4] | "PACK" or "PACA"
+04 | u32     | size of file (decompressed if PACA)
+08 | no idea (FEFF0100)
+0C | u16     | entry count in entry offset table
+0E | u16     | offset of entry offset table

entry offset table:
    table of u32 offsets to entry structs

offset table link to this entry struct:
+00 | u16    | offset of data from here (aka size of header + filename)
+02 | u16    | number of padding bytes used for alignment (I think? also this seems to be unused)
+04 | u32    | size of data
+08 | char[] | filename

"PACA" from end:
    -08 | 3byte | offset (down from end) of lower bound
    -05 | 1byte | offset (down from end) of upper bound
    -04 | 3byte | size of unpacked data?

    I think this may be some lzss again, but backwards
    see paca_decomp.s for decompressor disasm, or tools/rab/compression.cc for C++ impl
