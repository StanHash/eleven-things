folder scripts is full of pack files that contain at least one script.cnut file
that file is a compiled squirrel script

get the decompiled file:
mkdir unpack_dir
tools/rab/rab path/to/script/xyz.pack unpack_dir
tools/nutcracker/nutcracker unpack_dir/script.cnut > script.nut

sometimes there's also a ie.bxon file. bxon contain strings I think
