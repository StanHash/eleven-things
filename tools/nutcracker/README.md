# nutcracker

This is squirrel 2 cnut decompiler.

The original was apparently written by a mysterious DamianXVI, with no licence attached =/ I grabbed it from the first commit in [this fork][StLyn4/nutcracker], where they claim to have gotten it from [a CheatEngine.org thread][CE Thread] (I realize now that the download link there isn't dead oops).

I made some modifications so that it builds on my system (And also applied my clang-format because I could).
